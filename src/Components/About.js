          <p>
            The lorem ipsum is based on De finibus bonorum et malorum, a Latin
            text written by Cicero in 45 BC. Typographers and printers have used
            passages from this work for formatting since the 16th century. Many
            words have been added or modified over the centuries. As a result,
            the lorem ipsum is no longer considered Latin, even though it looks
            a lot like it.

            Hi there! I’m Jan, an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer based in
            NYC. If I’m not battling self-spawned bugs, you can catch me binge
            watching Anime, being forced to watch Gilmore Girls for the
            millionth time, or planning a getaway trip with my lovely wife.
